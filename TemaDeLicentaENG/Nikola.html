                <h2>Text about Nikola :</h2>
                <p>
                    Nikola is a boy who was born in the golden years after the war, of course he didn't know about the war, but the war 
                    probably took its toll on him. He was born on October 19 in the city of Kladovo in Serbia, after midnight around one 
                    o'clock in the morning. In childhood he was very thin and short, which changed in the future (in terms of weight loss). 
                    Since he was a child, Nikola always wanted to become a footballer and coached football for his club in the city, "Djerdap". 
                    He had many football idols and because of his love for football, he started training. He coached football for 8 years, but, 
                    unfortunately, the time has come for Nikola to choose whether he will go to school and learn something new or choose football 
                    as his life's work. Of course, Nikola didn't want to play with his life, so he chose school. He finished primary and secondary 
                    school in his hometown, in Kladovo, and enrolled in university abroad, i.e. in Romania. In childhood, Nikola was very diligent, 
                    which remained when he grew up. While he was in primary and secondary school, he helped his parents in the shop at the green market 
                    in Kladovo where his parents worked and where he works now. Nikola likes good cars, good food, beautiful women, he likes social sports,
                    he likes to travel and discover new things, meet new friends and learn something new. In childhood, he did not travel much due to financial 
                    reasons that changed over time, so later he started to travel and meet new friends and new countries.

                        As a child, Nikola was a blond, mischievous boy who liked to have a lot of toys. He was voluble but also a decent boy, 
                        obedient and he knew what his parents really meant, whenever his parents said something, he listened to what his parents said. 
                        He liked to have toys, which he had, his parents always bought him something new to calm him down. Next to him, of course, he 
                        has his brother Marko, with whom he spent a lot of time outside playing football, tennis or any other children's game. In childhood, 
                        he did not have many friends, only a few neighbors with whom he always stayed. They spent time playing with toys or some social games. 
                        Nikola loved football as a child, which is why he started training. He played football every day, constantly, without getting tired. 
                        That's how he started to travel. With the help of football, he traveled for the first time to Austria and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
                        He met many new friends, some from Serbia, others from France, Austria...

                    In high school he met many new friends and they also got along very well and Nikola was in the best class of that generation. 
                    High school lasted 4 years, but during that time Nikola learned many new things, he also got to know something new and that is programming, 
                    which he became interested in. Since then, Nikola started to familiarize himself with something difficult, but interesting for him, he liked 
                    it and started to learn. Which he continued later at the Faculty. At the end of high school, he received his diploma, but Nikola wanted to study 
                    further, so he enrolled in the Faculty. He wanted to learn programming, so he enrolled in the Faculty of Informatics. Besides football, 
                    this is another thing that started to interest him very quickly.

                    changed many things for him. The way of life and the way they treat people, up to the way Nikola handles himself in a foreign country, also 
                    changed the fact that Nikola started to travel a lot by train, which he hadn't done before, but he liked it a lot . . At the beginning of the 
                    Faculty, Nikola was resident in a country that he had not known until then, but over time he met a lot of new friends and got to know the country itself.
                    At the university, he gained many new knowledge and met many new teachers. At the beginning, college seemed very difficult, not because of the material,
                    but because of the situation that gripped the world, i.e. COVID-19. This disease made it difficult for Nikola to study and everything else, everything 
                    became easier when school started face to face and when Nikola got to know new things for the first time, which he liked.

                        I fell in love with football since I was little. When I first saw a football player on the field, I immediately wanted to be there. Immediately after that moment, 
                        I asked my parents to sign me up for football in my local team, "FK ĐERDAP". Of course, my parents signed me up and I immediately started training. I really liked 
                        football as a game and I met new friends. I went to every training and football was my first "love". With the help of football, I started traveling to other countries 
                        such as: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria, Romania. I really liked the fact that I can travel with the help of football and I can do what I like. After some time, 
                        I wanted this to become my life's work and to do this every day. I was very happy while training and playing matches with my team. I played in various categories 
                        from small pioneers to the first team of the city club. Unfortunately, over the years, the club collapsed and no one wanted to train anymore. I was also the captain 
                        of the team for a few years, until the moment I had to choose between school and football, which I didn't like at all. It was very difficult for me to choose, but 
                        I chose the school because it was safe for me. With football, I wasn't sure if he would live in our city and if I would succeed with him. With the choice of school, 
                        I said goodbye to football and the coach. I haven't had time to train, but I still play football in my spare time with my friends.

                        I didn't travel much as a child, but when I grew up I started traveling a lot, both with my parents and with friends. Also, when I enrolled in college 
                        abroad, I started to use the train a lot as a means of transportation, which I liked a lot and was something new for me. I have not traveled the whole 
                        world, but I have traveled to many countries, of course I would not stop here, I would like to travel much more to meet new people and see a new country. 
                        I traveled by plane once, which I would like to do again and go a little further this time to a new country I have never been to before. My dream is to 
                        go to Dubai, which I hope will come true.

                        Like any boy, I like cars and automobiles in the world. As a child, I always wanted to go to the car showroom where I can see all 
                        the most prestigious and newest car models. My favorite car is the Range Rover Evoque, which I always wanted to own. Of course, 
                        there are many supercars that I would like to own, but I still think that it is too much for me. As for music, I listen to any type 
                        and I have no problem listening to foreign songs. Also, I like watching movies more than reading books, so I spend a lot of time at the cinema.
